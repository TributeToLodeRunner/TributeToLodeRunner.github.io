An Action Game and Game Generator

# PLAYING THE GAME

You are a Galactic Commando deep in enemy territory. 
Power hungry leaders of the repressive Bungeling Empire have stolen a fortune in gold from the people by means of excessive fast food taxes. 
Your task? To infiltrate each of 150 different treasury rooms, evade the deadly Bungeling guards, and recover every chest of Bungeling booty.

## TO START:

After booting, the program automatically begins a self-playing demo of three different levels of play.
Watch them to get a sense of game play. To begin play, press any key (except "return") or push the joystick button. 
Your player will start to flash. Move your player or push a joystick button to begin game action.

## KEYBOARD COMMANDS:

- ARROW UP = move up
- ARROW DOWN = move down 
- ARROW LEFT = move left
- ARROW RIGHT = move right
- Z = dig left 
- X = dig right

## GAME PLAY:
To complete a level, you must collect all the gold chests in a scene. 
When you succeed, you may then climb to the top of the screen and enter the next level. 
You will also gain bonus points and earn an extra life for each level you complete. You start with 5 lives.

You will use your laser drill pistol to drill pits and passageways through brick floors. 
You may dig through fissured bricks only, not through solid surfaces, and holes must be drilled all the way through to be effective.
If a Bungeling guard falls into a pit and gets stuck, it will become safe (for a moment) for you to run over him; 
also, he will release any gold he is carrying. Any holes that you've drilled will fill in again after a period of time, 
and guards caught in them when they refill will die and be replenished by new guards at the top of the screen. 
Be careful: Guards can climb out of pits that do not close up around them. 
Your player, however, cannot climb out of pits and will die if trapped in a pit that is only a single brick wide.

You will notice that gold chests carried by enemy guards cease to be visible. If you have picked up all the visible gold on the screen 
and the ladder leading to the next level has not yet appeared or you cannot reach the next level by climbing to the highest part of the screen, 
one or more of the guards is still carrying gold. You must trap the guards in a pit and pick up their gold. 
If an enemy carrying gold falls into a "dead end" that he and you are unable to leave, you will not 
be able to get that gold chest safely. If stuck in a "dead end", press CTRL-A to continue (see below).

## SCORING:
| event | points |
| --- | --- |
| Completing a level | 1500 |
| Picking up a gold chest | 250 |
| Trapping an enemy | 75 |
| Enemy dying in a hole | 75 |



## HIGH SCORES:

If you achieve a new high score, a high score list will appear on the screen at game's end. 
Type in your initials then press RETURN. 
Note: You can use the left and right arrow keys to make corrections before pressing RETURN.

## SPECIAL KEYS: 
 - **CTRL-A** aborts man if stuck without means of death or escape
 - **BACKSPACE** back to main menu

Cheat keys:
 - **CTRL-,** jump next level
 - **CTRL-.** jump prev level


Using either of the two "cheat keys" forfeits your high score attempt for that game. 
So does beginning a session at any level other than the first level 001)
